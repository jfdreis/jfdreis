### Hi there, I am José 👋

I am a Maths PhD student at [Nova University of Lisbon, FCT](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en), Portugal. In my thesis I used theory of noncommutative motives to solve problems in Algebraic Geometry and in Algebraic topology.

- 🌱 Recently, I decided to learn Cryptography and I'm interested in Zero Knowledge proofs.
