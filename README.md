### Hi there, I am Zé 👋

I hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Nova University of Lisbon, FCT](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en), where I applied the theory of noncommutative motives to problems in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. I also hold an M.Sc. in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London and a B.Sc. in Mathematics.

🚀 Over the past two year, I have been exploring and working in the field of cryptography, focusing on **Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)** and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs ZKPs**. During this time, I authored technical blogpost, contributed to [nilRAG](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nilrag), a privacy-preserving retrieval-augmented generation system, and have been actively involved in upgrading the implementation of a Threshold ECDSA signature from the [CGGMP21](https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/cggmp21) paper to its updated CGGMP24 version by, for example, implementing ZKPs.
